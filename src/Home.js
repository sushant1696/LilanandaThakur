                    Baba Sri had another dream too, that of a big modern hospital adjacent to Lila Dham. The dream
                    that could help people seek cure of their  bodily ailments at the hospital besides peace of
                    mind at the temple. He initiated work on the project in 1978 itself, which however, came to a
                    sudden halt when he attained Mahasamadhi in July 1980. His disciples, followers and admirers
                    were stunned by the event; yet they did not lose heart and with unflinching faith in Baba
                    Sriâ€™s powers, they went ahead with the unfinished work on his twin dreams-first, completion
                    of the marble temple till 1977 and, thereafter commencement of fresh work on the hospital
                    project.He did not believe in preaching; so he never reached any sermons. He believes in
                    practice and he practice Hari Naam and Anna Daan throughout his life time for fulfilling
                    the goal of Jana Seva. His hospital project is a manifestation of that philosophy of public
                    service.</p></div>
