                <p>Srimad Lilanand Thakur Introduction
                The early life of Sri Lilanand Thakur Pagal Baba is not known: only bits of information are
                available. He was born at Balla Ratanhganj in Dist, Mymensing, now in Bangladesh.His father
                was Shri KaliCharan Chakravarty who was a merchant. But worldly business had no attraction
                for Baba Sri who took the path of Sanyas and roamed about in jungles, hills and caves in
                 search of God.</p>
                <p>Sometime prior to August 1947, Baba Sre came over to Assam where he organized Akhand Kirtan
                in a village called Sapatgram (Dist. Dhubri). His hut soon turned into a big Ashram and as
                he used to get lost in the fervour of Harinam Sankirtan, he was nicknamed “Pagal Baba” by
                his followers. Thereafter, he set up another Ashram at Barjhar (Dist. Darang) and stories
                of his magical “Lal Roomal” and miraculous curse of sick persons spread far and wide which
                attracted many followers from Guwahati, Kolkata and other places. In 1964, Pagal Baba
                arrived in Vrindaban which, according to him, was his real home where Lord Krishna had played
                his childhood ‘leelas’. He setup Lila Kunj Ashram and Rashbehari Mandir in Gyan Gudri, near
                Jamuna bank, starting Akhand Kirtan and Daridra-Narayan Seva. A few years later, he embarked
                upon construction of a marble temple, nine storied high, on the main road to Mathura. It was
                his conviction that this magnificent temple, a living abode of Gods and Goddesses, would in
                due course of time attract more people than Taj Mahal at Agra.</p>
                <h3>His Vision:</h3>
                <p>
                    Baba Sri had another dream too, that of a big modern hospital adjacent to Lila Dham. The dream
                    that could help people seek cure of their  bodily ailments at the hospital besides peace of
                    mind at the temple. He initiated work on the project in 1978 itself, which however, came to a
                    sudden halt when he attained Mahasamadhi in July 1980. His disciples, followers and admirers
                    were stunned by the event; yet they did not lose heart and with unflinching faith in Baba
                    Sri’s powers, they went ahead with the unfinished work on his twin dreams-first, completion
                    of the marble temple till 1977 and, thereafter commencement of fresh work on the hospital
                    project.He did not believe in preaching; so he never reached any sermons. He believes in
                    practice and he practice Hari Naam and Anna Daan throughout his life time for fulfilling
                    the goal of Jana Seva. His hospital project is a manifestation of that philosophy of public
                    service.</p>
